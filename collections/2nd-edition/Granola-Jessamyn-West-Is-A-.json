  "notes": "Jessamyn West is an author/librarian living a modern bohemian lifestyle at one time living between Seattle and rural Vermont.   During this period she'd wrote to her readership stating that anyone who ate cereal would be well served to make their own granola. Homemade is in another class of food from what you get at most any  kind of store.   Not quite fair to even compare the two.    This is good \"mountain aire stylee\" -- one bowl will generally leave even monster eaters pretty well packed in.",

  "preparation": "Separately mix wet and dry ingredients and combine both.  Quality ingredients on the honey and syrup do make a difference.Evenly spread the mix in a 13\"x9\" glass dish and bake for 15 minutes at 350F. Stir in dried fruit and bake an additional fifteen minutes or until golden brown. Remove from heat and spoon the mixture onto a baking tray covered in baking parchment or waxed paper and let cool completely before serving or storing in an airtight container.Much of the cereal's basic nature can be changed quite a bit by the amount of baking and the carmelization of the sugars.  Longer roast times will create a stronger and flakier final product.",

  "notes": "My gramps used to make this extraordinary cookies which probably had in no small part something to do with  my girth growing  up.  I consider them at this point a \"lost\" recipe worth re-engineering, and there's very few of  those currently under development  these days.  As such, I'm going to collect a dozen or so damned recipes  before I find \"The One\" and you'll just hafta suffer until  then.  My mom suffers me to believe that it was just  \"off a box of oatmeal\" but there was something special in Gramps' recipe that I  haven't quite found yet in any of  the recipes I've tried.",

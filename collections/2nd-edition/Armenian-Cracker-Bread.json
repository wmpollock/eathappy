  "preparation": "Preheat oven to 450F.  In a small bowl beat eggs and milkIn a large bowl mix  flour, sugar and salt.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Gradually blend in egg mixture and mix until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.On a floured board lightly knead dough to form a smooth ball.  Divide the dough into 4 parts -- wrap 3 of them in plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.  Roll out and bake one portion at a time.On the floured surface roll out a ball of dough to about 1/8 inch thick.  Add flour as needed to prevent sticking.  Reshape into a ball, then roll out again to a 14-inch circle.Transfer carefully to a greased baking sheet or pizza pan.  Brush lightly with water, then sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sesame seed.Place a shallow pan of hot water on bottom rack of oven.  Place baking sheet on rack above it and bake 3 minutes.  Remove water, reduce heat to 300F and bake until bread is blistered, feels dry to the touch, and is lightly browned (12 to 15 minutes).  Cool on a wire rack.Repeat rolling and baking with remaining portions of dough.When rounds of bread are crisp and cool, break into irregular pieces and serve.",

  "notes": "Gum always made this for us when we'd come visiting.  She used a ceramic blackbird poking through the center  of the crust to  keep it from collapsing in on itself overly much and to work as a vent.  The little bastards are  hard to find, but well worth the  effort -- the pie wouldn't look the same without the little head peeping out. This being said, my crust generally falls in but its still tasty.",

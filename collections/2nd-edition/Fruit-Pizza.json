Mix cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy and spread over cooled crust.  Cover with fruit:  fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries are delicious as are drained canned peaches and apricots.  If the fruit will discolor (like bananas), cover with a glaze of 1/3 cup preserves and 2 tablespoons water.",

  "notes": "I have already decided that I will, in future editions, list this as \"Lime Cream Sauce (With Pork)\".  The sauce itself is the thing here, whatever meat you put it upon is merely a window-dressing.  If one cannot reasonably come across pork tenderloin, I'm sure pork chops, chicken and lightly-flavored fish would do nicely smothered in this sauce as well.Rated \"Fantastic!\" by my mother.",

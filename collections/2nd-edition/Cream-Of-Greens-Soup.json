  "notes": "Originally  this recipe called for 6-8 slices of bacon to be cooked first in the  pan, using the rendered oil to saute the onions and the cooked bacon as a serving-time garnish, but I didn't find it added much to the recipe other than the horrible knowledge that one had added 8 slices of bacon unnecessarily.",

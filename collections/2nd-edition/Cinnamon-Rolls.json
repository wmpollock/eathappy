Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in two equal parts.  Roll each portion into rectangles and spread with softened butter.  Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.Roll length-wise in the longest direction with the coating on the inside like you would if anyone still made jelly rolls.  Slice rolls in 2\" intervals.

Prepare topping by cooking ingredients until butter has melted and pour over rolls immediately before baking at 375F for 25 minutes.Turn out onto serving plate immediately after removing from oven.",

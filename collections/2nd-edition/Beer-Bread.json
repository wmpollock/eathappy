  "notes": "What they call \"quick breads\" -- it gets its rising power from the beer and so-called chemical leavening agents,  thereby making it the sort of thing you could actually think about the afternoon you were planning dinner and  still see it on your supper table.  A beautiful recipe as it can be greatly modified by simply changing the beer  ingredient.",

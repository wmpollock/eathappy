  "notes": "A recipe from my Uncle Patrick's \"bachelor days\", which were long and varied.  Somewhere exists a recipe for  Tuna  Surprise which contained lots of strange things such as peas (not to mention \"hot tuna\") but was generally  pretty tasty.  Sadly I wouldn't rediscover this recipe until well -after- college.  Makes a tasty winter meal.",

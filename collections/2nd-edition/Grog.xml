  <preparation>The simplest preparation is to pour 3/4 mug's worth of water, the lemon juice and sugar into a microwave-safe mug and heat in the microwave oven until near-boiling, then add the rum on top. This ensures that the restorative value of the alcohol is not burned off.

Those who happen to have a tea kettle are encouraged to change the order of ingredients to be added: sugar first, lemon followed by rum with the hot water on top of that.

Stir briskly.

  <notes>While we don't have the biting cold of what one would consider a "real" winter, we do suffer a bit of the deep, penetrating fog now and again here in the central valley.  Back in my college days I found that this was a heavenly treat both on nights when I could use some warming as well as some sound sleep.

As legend has it, grog originated as a drink in the days of the sailing ships, where the ship's surgeon wanted to ensure everyone got a proper dose of vitamin C and, well, since they had to drink their rum portion in *some* way.</notes>

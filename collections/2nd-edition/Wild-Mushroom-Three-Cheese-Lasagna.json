  "preparation": "SUMMARY:  70 minutes total cook time & garnish.  15 minutes sitting.Rinse porcini mushrooms, pour soak 30 minutes in 1 cup hot water. Sauce: Heat oil, add onion and cook until tender.  Add mushrooms until they soften.  Add rosemary & crushed red pepper & toss a few times. Add wine & mushroom liquid & boil until reduced by half.  Add tomatoes, reduce heat until sauce is thick -- this part always seems to take an eternity.  Season with salt & pepper. [cheat: added a little sage & Italian seasoning to make up for the lack of porcini]Filling: Combine ricotta, Parmesan & pesto.  Season w/salt & pepper. Stir in the 2 eggs & yolk to the mix.  Aren't you glad you seasoned BEFORE this step?Build: 1/4 sauce over dish          noodles          half of filling          1/4 sauce          1/3 goat cheese          noodles          rest of filling          1/4 sauce          1/3 goat cheese          noodles          rest of sauce & goat cheese.I always end up shorting myself sauce so that the last layer is pretty thin, but it never seems to matter much.Cook at 350 deg for 35 mins covered, 35 mins uncovered.Garnish with tomato & let stand 15 mins.",

  "notes": "I also made this for the first time at the 2000 \"Lonely Heart's Dinner\".  Jennifer Jones was coming over and  she's not just a hottie  but a vegetarian, so I detoured my second pan of lasagna into this and its never been  second-best.  It worked out nicely in terms of  prep since I could make it and another lasagna the night before  and just needed to throw them into the pan.  Sadly, I was a bit too buzzed by the time dinner came on to  remember to start the stove...  This is really tasty but ends up being kind of expensive with several pricey  mushrooms among the ingredients. Also, a pain in  the ass to find all four types.  Allegedly you can substitute  morels for the porcini, but I've never tried it -- porcinis scare me for  some reason.  I've substituted portobello  for the shitakes when I haven't been able to find the latter fresh and it hasn't mattered.   I've also dodged the  porcini by using dried mushroom mixes from the supermarket that work out pretty good.   Bon Appetit, March  1994 (via Epicurious)",

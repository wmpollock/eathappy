I always associated marinated mushrooms with my gramma's guests coming over as a child.  My gramma was from an  entirely different era in Sacramento history than my own and I think this may have  been a customary bring-along among their  set.  \"Make not the marinated mushrooms in the summertime, for  they shall be Brought Along.\"  A good policy.",

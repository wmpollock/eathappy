  "notes": "Our friend Lori asked us to game-sit her house while she was away during the early part of the 2004-2005  King's Season and in her absence we took to cooking up fine meals to keep up our strength during the game.  I  dusted off this recipe on a cold near-winter day and it proved pleasantly simple and wonderfully tasty.",

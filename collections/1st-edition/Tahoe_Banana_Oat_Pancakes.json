  "notes": "My friend Kristi had access to a cabin in Tahoe and would invite all of us up for a weekend of skiing and  drunken frivolity.   Knowing that I was going to be on the hook for at least one meal, I delved for the first  time into Epicurious and dug up these  hearty fellers.  I'll forever remember wandering about the Raley's  down at Stateline in search of Wheat Germ.    As a testament to the durability of that stuff, I still had a  container of it from that trip years later.  From Epicurious/Bon Appetit 7/97",

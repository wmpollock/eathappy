  "name": "Flaky Pie Crust",
  "preparation": "In a large bowl mix flour and salt.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in lard and butter until mixture is crumbly and particles are the size of small dried peas. Mixing lightly with a fork, sprinkle on water, 1 tablespoon at a time,  until dough begins to cling together.  With your hands press dough into 2 flattened balls of equal size.  Enclose in plastic wrap to prevent dough from drying out while preparing filling.  To avoid stickiness, refrigerate up to a day. Roll out on a lightly floured surface, using short, firm strokes to achieve uniform thinness, according to recipe directions.",

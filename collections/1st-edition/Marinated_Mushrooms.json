  "notes": "**UNTRIED** I have no clue where this recipe comes from.  Could be my mom's collection but I think I'd be a lot more  excited about it if it  were.  I always associated marinated mushrooms with my gramma's guests coming  over as a child. My gramma was from an  entirely different era in Sacramento history than my own and I  think this may have been a customary bring-along among their  set.  \"Make not the marinated  mushrooms in the summertime, for they shall be Brought Along.\"  A good policy.",

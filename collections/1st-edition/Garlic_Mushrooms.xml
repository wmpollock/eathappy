  <notes>I consider this a fairly "short" recipe, meaning we're a little light on the mixture here, at least for 20  standard supermarket mushrooms.  I usually just eyeball this one until the proportions look right:  twice  as much parsley as cheese and enough butter to hold it all together. 

I generally like making the butter mixture ahead of time and leave it formed in a ball overnight to let the  flavors develop a bit before removing it and resoftening to use. From the Garlic Festival Cookbook</notes>

  <preparation>Soften butter.  Mix garlic, parsley, Parmesan and butter together and let sit.  Clean and remove stems from the mushrooms.  Fill caps with mixture and set in a 13"x9" glass dish.  

Cook at 400F or under the broiler until the mushrooms begin to soften a bit.  The crust will likely brown a bit, especially in the broiler.</preparation>

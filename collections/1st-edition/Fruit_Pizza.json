  "preparation": "Slice and press together the sugar cookie roll in a 12-inch greased pizza pan.  Baked at 350 degrees for 11 to 15 minutes.  Cool.  Mix cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy and spread over cooled crust.  Cover with fruit.  Strawberries, raspberries and blueberries are delicious as well as drained canned peaches and apricots.  If the fruit will discolor (like bananas), cover with a glaze of 1/3 cup preserves and 2 tablespoons water."

  <preparation>Press fresh ground pepper well onto both sides of patty, let stand for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle light layer of salt in heavy pan. Head until salt turns a light brown.  Place patties in pan and brown on each side.  When patty is well browned on other side add Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and butter onto each patty.  Pour 1/3 cup of brandy over all patties, reduce heat and light brandy.  Spoon brandy over all patties and serve immediately.

  <notes>**UNTRIED** I grew up in the 70s when cooking was supposed to be a fairly calm affair.  The best part of this recipe as  a kid is when my mom  would call us over and the cooking would suddenly and intentionally be LIT  AFLAME!  FOR SEVERAL SECONDS!  It was a fairly punk-rock dish.</notes>

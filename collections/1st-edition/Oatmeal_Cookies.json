I consider them at this point a \"lost\" recipe worth re-engineering, and there's  very few of those currently under development  these days.  As such, I'm going to collect a dozen or so  damned recipes before I find \"The One\" and you'll just hafta suffer until  then.  My mom suffers me to  believe that it was just \"off a box of oatmeal\" but there was something special in Gramps' recipe that I   haven't quite found yet in any of the recipes I've tried.",

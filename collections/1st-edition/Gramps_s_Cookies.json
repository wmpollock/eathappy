  "notes": "For a long time I'd thought the recipe for my grandfather's cookies were lost to the kitchens of time.   They were such good cookies and are one of the most memorable things from our weekend visits.  I recently found myself cleaning out my father's office and came across my Grandmother's old recipe box,   in which I found this jem in my Grandmother's distinctive hand.",

  "preparation": "Mix ground pork and ground beef together and add the rest of the ingredients to the mix.  Form small meatballs and set aside.In a  large pot, fry minced onion and garlic together in 1/4 cup of oil or just enough to lightly coat everything.   When onions have softened some add the beef stock and tomato sauce and heat to boiling.  Add meatballs to broth and cover.  Reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes.  The soup will gain character as the cooking time is lengthened -- at about an hour and a half the meatballs will start to degrade pleasantly.Ten minutes before serving add the sprig of mint to the broth and remove prior to serving.",

  "notes": "This isn't cursed in the sense that it's bad for you or will put some sort of kind of Ring-like hex on you.  Rather,  I've entered this little summary like five times and something bad keeps happening to it. Sr. Arturo used to run this joint in Walnut Creek where they always had a pot of this stuff on the back burner.   This recipe is missing a few ingredients yet before its \"just like\" Arturo's but as his recipe went with his  restaurant, I'm afraid this will have to do until I can figure out what's missing.  I use a piece of software called AccuChef to do my entry for this thing and this recipe came from it's \"MEX\"  database originally.",

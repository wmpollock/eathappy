  "preparation": "Beat mixture and let stand for 1/2 hour.  Beat again and bake at 400\u00ba for 30-45 minutes.  Use 1/4 cup* suet or Crisco.  Make sure ingredients are room temperature.  Glass dish should be already hot before putting batter in.It just said \"1/4\" before, I assume cup.  Suet is pretty nasty stuff but I would assume its tastier than plain ol' Crisco.  I would assume the latter doesn't blow out your heart as much and is -certainly- easier to find."

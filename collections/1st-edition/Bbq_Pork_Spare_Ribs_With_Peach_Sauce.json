  "preparation": "Sauce: In 3 quart saucepan, mix all ingredients.  Stir constantly while bringing sauce to boil over medium heat.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Cool sauce and puree.Ribs: Stud onion with cloves and place in 1 inch water with ribs and simmer for 30 minutes.  Drain ribs, brush generously with sauce and grill.** I remember there being some secret shortcut about only half-grilling the ribs and then doing the rest in a conventional oven after the crust had set, but some would properly consider this cheating."

  "preparation": "I'm not entirely sure whether or not this even needs to be in here, though I did rather screw things up so perhaps -someone-  might find this useful someday.  The Italian Panini is a thing of beauty -- happily warm with cheese and meats and stuff.  So good.  I was not attentive enough on  my last trip to really get much in the way of detail that I can recall aside from   1) special bread   2) tomato & mozzarella is purty  good   3) Salami &c is tasty -- to a point.To this I add   4) olive oil apparently does -not- go on the outside (nasty)and   5) the griddle side of a \"flippable\" waffle iron will work just as well as any fancy panini machine.   11/04 Update:  The trick, that I had forgotten, is that the bread itself is rather unique:  its a large, flat disc of bread.  One variety that we had back at the villa was \"schiacciata all'olio\", so maybe something there."

  "notes": "I consider this a fairly \"short\" recipe, meaning we're a little light on the mixture here, at least for 20  standard supermarket mushrooms.  I usually just eyeball this one until the proportions look right:  twice  as much parsley as cheese and enough butter to hold it all together. I generally like making the butter mixture ahead of time and leave it formed in a ball overnight to let the  flavors develop a bit before removing it and resoftening to use.

  "preparation": "Soften butter.  Mix garlic, parsley, Parmesan and butter together and let sit.  Clean and remove stems from the mushrooms.  Fill caps with mixture and set in a 13\"x9\" glass dish.  Cook at 400F or under the broiler until the mushrooms begin to soften a bit.  The crust will likely brown a bit, especially in the broiler."

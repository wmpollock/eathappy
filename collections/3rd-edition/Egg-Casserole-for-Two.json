  "name": "Egg Casserole for Two",
  "notes": "An egg casserole was in fact one of the things I had in mind making.  I recalled ordering breakfast at a small pizza-parlor type place in Vancouver and having it be quite excellent.  That one, with Mediterranean flavors of garlic, spinach, eggs and goat cheese over what seemed like undercooked pizza dough was plain excellent.  This sounds like more American Style Cookin'.",

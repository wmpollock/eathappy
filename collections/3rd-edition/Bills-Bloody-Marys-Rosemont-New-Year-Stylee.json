  "notes": "Another cursed recipe.  Over the course of a week at Sea Ranch I'd come up with the killer Bloody Mary recipe that took me the better part of a week to sus out.  And man, it had a little of everything.  When condiments are use-or-loose, suddenly pouring through that horseradish sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?Its was kind of a fussy recipe and while this one is maybe not as ambrosial, it is certainly serviceable enough to fly in Italy where I'd wanted it most.",

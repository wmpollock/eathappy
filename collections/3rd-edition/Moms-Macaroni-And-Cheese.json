  "notes": "This was my number-one favorite dish when I was a kid and the one most often requested as a birthday treat.   This recipe makes a nice, creamy Mac & Cheese with a golden crumb top that is well worth the effort.  In later years I've found that adding a dash of Sriracha-brand hot sauce to the mix gives the dish a loverly lingering warmth.Largely the cooking down of the sauce is done in two parts: one on the stove and one in the oven.  If there's not as much time spent on the former, or perhaps too much, the in-oven cook time can be modified a bit to cover so long as the top does not begin burning.",

When the consistency has evened out whisk in the de-chilled milk gradually and ensure butter/flour mixture is mixed through.Continue to stir until sauce has thickened to the consistency of light gravy.  Add spices and cheese.  Stir occasionally until cheese melts and sauce re-thickens.In 1.5 quart  casserole dish, mix macaroni and sauce.

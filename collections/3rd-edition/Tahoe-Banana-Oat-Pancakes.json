  "notes": "My friend Kristi had access to a cabin in Tahoe and used to invite us all up for a weekend of skiing and frivolity.   Knowing that I was going to be on the hook for at least one meal, I delved for the first time into  Epicurious and dug up these hearty fellers.  I recall searching high and low for wheat germ that first time at the unfamiliar Stateline Raley's megamarket. Double whammy: where'd you'd find it, and where'd you find it -here-.Raleys is like that.",

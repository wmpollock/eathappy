  "notes": "The Pampered Chef claims that this and their other Small Oval Baker recipe are preparable in a toaster oven of equivalent temperature.  This is probably notable in their belief that one might have a toaster oven of such quality.  I suppose if you are a Pampered Chef type, you've got a quality toaster oven I suppose.  As for me, I have never been so fortunate.",

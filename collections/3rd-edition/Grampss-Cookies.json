  "notes": "For a long time I'd thought the recipe for my grandfather's cookies were lost to the kitchens of time.  They were  such good cookies and are one of the most memorable things from our weekend visits.  While cleaning out my father's office several years back I came across my Grandmother's old recipe box,  in  which I found this gem in my Grandmother's distinctive hand.  I've substituted sunflower seeds for the walnuts successfully and generally leave out the coconut. Gramps would swap the wanuts out for candied cherry halves around:  maybe you will too.",

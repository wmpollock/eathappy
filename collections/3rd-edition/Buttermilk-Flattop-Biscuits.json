  "notes": "These make flat-top biscuits.  One can get either a square edge (which I kind of prefer) by leaving the tops dry or a prettier rounded golden slick top by brushing with remaining buttermilk.My original run at the full Tbl for salt made some pretty salty biscuits.  It's better at half.",

  "preparation": "In a large bowl mix together flour, salt, baking poder and baking soda.  Cut in the shortening until the mixture forms coarse crumbs.  Make a well and add 1 cup buttermilk.  Quickly cut dry ingredients into the buttermilk to form a sticky dough.  Add more buttermilk as necesary.Turn out the dough on a floured surfaceand foldover itself 3-4 times.   Press out to 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches thick: biscuits will double when cooked.  The larger size allows for modest eating of only halves. Section with a 3-inch cutter or floured rim of a pint glass abd arrange on an ungreased cooke sheed.  Optionally brush with buttermilk for rounded top.Bake at 375F for 20-25 minutes or until golden.",

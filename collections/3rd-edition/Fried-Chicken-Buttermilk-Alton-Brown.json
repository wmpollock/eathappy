  "notes": "I trust Alton Brown as he's a guy in the south who is kind of a universal foodie and knows good bad-for-you food when he sees it.  If he's going to put his finger on a buttermilk fried chicken recipe and you need one, he'll be your friend.In my family this was the Other Sort of Fried Chicken we only ever discreetly ate at regional greasy spoons of yore.  For some reason forbidden or unknown preparation in our house though our family has a fair amount of same-region heritage as these guys.",

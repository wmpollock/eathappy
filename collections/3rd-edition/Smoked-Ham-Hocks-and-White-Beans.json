  "notes": "The Chronicle's white bean of choice was \"cranberry beans\" which I'd not heard of before.  Their substitute was \"other white been like cannellinis.\"  Foodreference.com sugests flavor alternates as pinto before red kidney bean.The thing is all sort of overblown, really. TODO: STILL WORKING ITNEEDS RESEARCH:  While its nice of the Chron to include a recipe for Onion Confit, one that scales to the size of the recipe would be better.  The author says that you can break this recipe down \"in half or even thirds\" to hit the mark (which you'd be cheating .25 either way).  Since but they always find \"plenty of uses\" for a pile of soggy onions they provided the Big Recipe.  I'd rather be a .5 cup over than .25 cup under as that gives me an extra half to fiddle with.",

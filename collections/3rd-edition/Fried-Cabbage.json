In the ingredients \"green pepper\" is an Anaheim, Paseilla, etc.  This recipe includes some corrections by Raj with regards the cooking and selection of the green pepper.   Shanta calls for a \"sweet green pepper\" which I'd expect means a bell and cooks it with the mustard seeds.",

Raj cooks the green pepper at this point until soft, 2-3 minutes.  Add the cabbage and stir, mixing in the spices until well blended.  Cook to preferred doneness (5-20 minutes), stirring occasionally to keep the cabbage from harm.Fully cooked cabbage should be half in volume from the original.  Remove from heat when done and mix in lemon juice.",

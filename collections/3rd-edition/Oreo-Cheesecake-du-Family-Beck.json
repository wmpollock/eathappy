  "notes": "The Beck family likes to cook and kindly provided me on my birthday I believe: I should have had the Beck's sign it.  I try to be pretty respectful of it as a Sekrit Recipe Book but this one is too good to keep out of circulation.  Truly the king of Oreo Cheesecakes: it comes out pretty well every time and is generally loved by all.",

Line the bottom of a 9\" springform pan with parchment and form even crust with 1/2\" sides using cookie-butter mixture.  Put in the refrigerator or freezer to firm up: 10/20 minutes.In a mixer, beat together cream cheese, sugar and half and half until smooth.  Add eggs, flour and vanilla.  Pour half of the mixture over the chilled crust.  Break down the remaining cookies and scatter over mixture, overlapping cookies if necessary.  Pour in the remaining cookies.Bake at 300F for about 1 hour 20 minutes: until the center jiggles only slightly when nudged.  Mom Beck advises being vigilant in the last 20 minutes.  Cool cake on a wire rack before chilling at least four hours before serving.",

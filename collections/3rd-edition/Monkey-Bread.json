  "notes": "Sadly no monkey is included in monkey bread.  The bread does, however, pull apart charmingly and has a lovely crust. The basic recipe requires a bundt pan or ring mold:  the outside requires the pan be pretty narrow to ensure the maximum amount of exposed space on the bread.  I'd imagine while pie pans would generally be out, anything with a width around 2.5-3\" might work as well (think small loaf pans, brioche pans, etc).A good, but not truly extraordinary bread, it does appear to have other legs:  coating the balls in cinnamon sugar and topping with cream cheese  icing allegedly tastes \"just like a Cinnabon!\", not that I'd know either way.",

  "name": "Oven Fried Garlic Chicken",
  "notes": "My mom mad a recipe remarkably similar to this. I suspected that her original source was either one of her Gilroy Garlic Festival cookbooks from her garlic periods or else a seemingly healthier alternative to normal fried chicken, but this recipe is fairly ubiquitous across the Internet with uncited sources, so hard to tell.  Perhaps its what passes for Modern American Home Cooking in 2005.Truly a fantastic recipe.",

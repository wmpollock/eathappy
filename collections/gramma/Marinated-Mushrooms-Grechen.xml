	<notes>Yeah -- doesn't seem like there's much to this recipe, does there?  It should be mentioned for the record that the Italian dressing specifically mentioned in the recipe was "Wishbone", which does contain a unique blend of herbs and spices, but not like the ol' packet kind wouldn't probably also work fine -- not like Wishbone is all that fine a recipe since canola oil went all big in '89...</notes>

  "notes": "I am not sure what you could call this in the modern age:  I think this sounds like it could be pretty interesting but I think you'd have a hard sell with \"well, its mousse!  Its uh, made with salmon!\"  Probably \"salmon spread\" these days?A bit of a curiosity on the cream measure.  The notation is \"1/c\" and its added by thirds, so a full cup makes sense.",

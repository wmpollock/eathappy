  "notes": "This recipe was the scene of no small amount of controversy in my house for many years and it a rather poor transcription of a man's recipe and legacy.  Problem is that the cookie recipe is \"as it is on the back of the box\", along with these other ingredients.Maybe this is so, but I've got a secret suspicion you'll find a more accurate representation of this recipe around here someplace else.",

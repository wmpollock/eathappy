  "notes": "Patrick was well known as a bachelor epicure, meaning he cooked well but typically with a mixture of at-hand ingredients and a minimum of fussiness.  This recipe lists \"1/2+\" sour cream:  another treatment I have for this same recipe lists 1/4 cup sour cream.  Its possible that this measure is supposed to be a 1/2 tsp, but that sounds too short to bother with.",

  "notes": "Known in some circles as \"Chocolate Pudding Desert\", a favorite of my mom's that she'd often make to go alongside lasagna for  the camp-wide cookout at Almanor.Its a pretty quick build -- I managed to do it in under an hour for James and Molly's Memorial Day dinner '05 and didn't even have time to leave for the store until 4 and still made it in time for six.Its mighty creamy and makes a mighty big pan.  Good for large-scale company and full of good, road-safe ingredients.",

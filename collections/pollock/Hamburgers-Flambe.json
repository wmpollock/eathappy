Pour 1/3 cup of brandy over all patties, reduce heat and light brandy, being careful not alight oneself or one's kitchen.  Spoon brandy over all patties and serve immediately.",

  "notes": "I grew up in the 70s when cooking was supposed to be a fairly calm affair.  The best part of this recipe as a kid is  when my mom  would call us over and the cooking would suddenly and intentionally be LIT AFLAME!  FOR  SEVERAL SECONDS!  It was a fairly punk-rock dish.While this seems like and -is- a very simple recipe, the lighting of Brandy in a hot dish is no joke -- I damned near singed off my arm hair the first time I made this in the test kitchen.  I believe speed with the match may be key.",

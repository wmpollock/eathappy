  "notes": "Another 70s favorite.  My mom always used Miller High Life in the recipe and was generally the only time she'd  ever be seen drinking any.  This recipe calls for cherry tomatoes and while good and fun, I was never able to  keep the cheese product on the shiny  tomato surface very long.",

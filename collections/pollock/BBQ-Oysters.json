  "notes": "The Surf Market in Gualala stocked a wonderful selection of seafood, including a pile of clams destined for our  grill.  This was a recipe I'd come across long before and wanted to try for an eternity, but as my local market  lacks reputable-looking bivalves, I'd had to wait until I was in the epicurean headquarters that is the Surf.  I  debated doubling the recipe which originally said that it would serve six and dang if I shouldn't.  Hot off the grill,  these little juicy numbers were some of the finest things I've ever BBQd.",

  "notes": "This comes from the Challenge folks: in my country a large deer stands before an alpine lake while in the background a glacier-covered crag-top is rendered in blue.  This is to signify that it is the milk product of another animal and that it has not been additionally salted.  Also, we package it in silver.  Gold is for oleomargarine.  I think they wrap \"European Style\" in paper, just like the salty kind.My guess is that in a pinch, butter will be butter.",

  "notes": "I'm 100% behind the Vegetarian cookbook authors when they say \"make your own bars, brother\". Their preparation lists a brief \"oatmeal, barley and wheat flakes and nuts of your choice\" as its primary guide to the complex world of muesli construction which is kind of weak sauce. I love this cookbook but detest some of the lazy steps that it takes which unecessarily cloud a kitchen under a bottle of, say \"pumpkin pie spice\" and not of its reagents which are probably also required to held in fresh quantities.",

  "preparation": "Combine all ingredients and mix in a 7\"x11\" pan.  Level mixture and bake for 30-35 minutes or until  light brown at 325F. Allow bars to cool slightly and scribe 12-16 pieces.  Allow to cool completely before breaking.  Needs research: The source says to turn it out on a wire rack after it is totally cool, which doesn't make much sense except to be fussy.  Maybe its not -quite- totally cool, so it'll come out easy.  Just cool enough to be totally safe, allright?",

  "notes": "In 2009 the San Francisco Chronicle was facing some hard times.  Their advertising revenue was draining way on all fronts and the paper had been bleeding money for some years.  In 2009 the paper reported that they had been told by their ownership that they would either be reformed, sold, or shuttered.Under this banner the Chron launched their \"144\" features; this being amongst the gala finales: local classics re-imagined.  It's-It is the mascot of every fat kid in Northern California and you cannot drive past the factory without wanting one.Extra bonus: you won't be driving by the factory too many times after eating a batch of these:  each one weighs in at 780 calories.  That being said, lots of interesting RESEARCH to  reconstruct more reasonable, future-forward fashions.",

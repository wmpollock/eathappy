  <notes>I was wondering as I was going through the trouble to make these if the biscuits were going to be that much better than what you'd get from either the can or ol' Bisquick and yes -- they are!  The crust comes out nice and crispy while the inside stays nice and moist.

This recipe makes the crumbly-top kind, if you didn't infer from the instructions...</notes>

  "notes": "Dad Beck was famous for making this in large batches and for a long while it was considered something of a state secret.  I believe that these measures were largely relaxed by 2005 or so, written recipes being spotted \"in the open\" around the Bryan household a time or two with D.B. allowing them to be copied so long as the key ingredient is obscured.  It is reproduced here in the interests of its longevity.",

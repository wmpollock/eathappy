  "notes": "These ribs were rated better than the Peach Sauce ribs by the Bryans and the Dawes who'd had a little of each.  I found this recipe personally a bit on the salty side but otherwise serviceably tasty.Working on a hunch I tried this as a jerky marinade and it worked great! The flavor lasted a goodly while in the fridge, usually the signature problem of homemade jerky.  Next time I'm going to double-dip 'em and see how that goes.",

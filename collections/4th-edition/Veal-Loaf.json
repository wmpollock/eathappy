  "name": "Veal Loaf",
  "notes": "There's something quaint about this recipe.  You've got to be a bit hard-hearted to consume veal in the modern era, though not so lamb and other juvenlie animals.  Mostly there were concerns about the ethics involved with industrial raising of calves in confined spaces for their entire existence, no matter how dumb.Veal is mostly left to those decadent dishes where it could not otherwise be replaces. Loafing it up seems downright -hardcore- in the face of all this.",

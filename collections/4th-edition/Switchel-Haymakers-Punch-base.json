  "notes": "I had been intrigued by haymaker's punch after reading about it long ago in an Old Farmer's Almanac.  Each of its ingredients in a beverage sounded absolutely repugnant.In a way it remains absolutely repugnant but I am enamored of it all the same.  I find its a bit calming on the system when poured over ice and then watered atop at perhaps a ratio of 1:5 or greater.  One does not want to hit the switchel layer full-on but continue to pour water atop the ice to dilute making for fantastic hydration opportunities for the otherwise unthirsty.",

  "preparation": "Mix together ingredients and chill.  Ages well.The original recipe calls for mixing with a quart of water and serving over ice but I find having the syrup on hand and mixing a glass as appropriate better and leave a smaller portion of switchel drowning in largely unmixed water.",

  "notes": "I started with dissatisfaction with the preparation and availability of turkey sausage and ended with the ultimate solution to pork rib trimmings, ground coarse.  This is a bit of a kitchen sink recipe largely intact from The Joy of Cooking.  I find that it is easier to mix up a large batch and have it on hand:  I'll mark it below as \"parts\":  I use a small measuring cup in tablespoon gradients but you could use ounces or cups or buckets for all it would matter.  Pick a unit.At present I am favoring swapping out a quarter of the salt for Accent (ALL HAIL MSG).",

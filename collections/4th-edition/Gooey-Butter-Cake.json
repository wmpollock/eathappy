  "notes": "Gooey + Butter == Good Times, so it sounds.The recipe comes from Kroger brand cream cheese, whereupon it recommends Kroger everything, naturally, including the afformentioned puddingles cake mix.  I consider this a nearly mythical ingredient as I've been unable to heretofore find it, needing it also for \"Herk's Coffee Cake\".When I find some, I will store it up in pre-millenial qualities.",

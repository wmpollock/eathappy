  "notes": "Jacqui's Margaritas serve as a cultural touchstone for me.  One thesis behind \"Eat Happy\" is the ability to successfully preserve and easily transport archetypes of my Northern Californian lifestyle.  In our Italian villa stay in 2004 the local Pam supermarket was raided for the following supplies after a quantity of tequila was discovered.  Some corners were, of course, cut.We used imported limes from South America there and found that one cannot mass produce the juice mix much beforehand as its a ripe bath for fermentation.  One would probably be safe the night before at least.Needs research:  lemon/lime syrup shelf time.",

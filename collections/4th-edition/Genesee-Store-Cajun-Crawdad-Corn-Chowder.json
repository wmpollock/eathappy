  "notes": "I am glad I find myself far, far away from Genesee as you'd find myself have moved right across from the store and gained some three hundred additional pounds.  Mighty tasty but dang, call your doctor beforehand.The paper allows as you could use lump crab meat in place of the crawdad and provides another excuse to pack it in when its in season.  This recipe will make you want to seek out some mudbugs though.",

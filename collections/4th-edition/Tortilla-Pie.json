  "notes": "I stood in fear of this recipe for some time, having horrible recollections about a dish involving tortillas and worrying that this one was perhaps it.  I've made it several times and under several conditions including make-ahead freezing and have not yet come up with a mystery method for fouling this thing up.  Delicious 70s goodness!The original recipe called for a \"small can of niblets\" which I like for sentimental reasons but we roll with big bags of frozen kernels at our house and that works fine too.",

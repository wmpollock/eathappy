  "notes": "This was an alternate recipe I tried and came out horrible.   Philly's website doesn't include the danged recipe anymore and even the closest one doesn't have a bake time!  I tried 425, had the thing come out an embarrassingly burnt mess and wish I hadn't made it.  I'm going to borrow the Bryan's as it only comes out better every time.",

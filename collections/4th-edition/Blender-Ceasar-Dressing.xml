	<notes>Far, far away from the traditional, bowl-turned recipe but nobody eats in restaurants like that anymore.  As far as quick-prep Ceasar goes, this is the goods and it gets better as time goes on.

In addition to dressing it makes a great impromptu sauce for meats and vegetables.  Its easy to use as a casual sauce but be warned that there is a fair amount of salt in the measure and in ingredients such as Parmesan cheese and Worcestershire sauce among its negative yet oh-so-tasty blandishments.

RAW EGG WARNING:
Uncooked eggs are known to occasionally carry diseases such as salmonella which may put sensitive groups at risk.  As such, its best to forewarn any of your guests that there's a bit of the very previously really fresh raw egg product before serving it and having an alternative on hand.</notes>

	<preparation>In blender, combine egg, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire, salt and pepper.  Mix until blended.  With the blender on its lowest speed, gradually add oil in a thin stream and continue to blend until dressing is thick and creamy.  Pour into jar.  Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour.  Per the original, "Keeps up five days" -- your risk tolerance may vary.

Let stand at room temperature for fifteen minutes before using.  Shake well.</preparation>

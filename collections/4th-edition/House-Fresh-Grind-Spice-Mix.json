  "preparation": "Mix ingredients to roughly the same proportion save for the dill which should be used no more than a third.  I often go short on the fennel as well as it can be a jarring note at times.In a grinder this has a tendency to separate out with the larger corns of pepper and red pepper flakes hanging about. Its best to re-integrate the contents of a grinder when about a third is left.",

Combine with doubled yeast mixture.  Allow this stage to double -- considerably quicker than a purely yeast bread but still on the order of 35 minutes or so.Heat griddle to medium-hot (325F-350F) and butter 4\" ring forms.  Place ring forms on griddle and spoon batter to 1/2\".  Cook until dry and bubbly on top and toast lightly on other side.Serve with copious amounts of butter, honey and some of your purloined Golden Syrup.",

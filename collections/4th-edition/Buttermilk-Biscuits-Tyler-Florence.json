  "notes": "I find Food TV's Tyler Florence kind of disgusting for some reason -- its a personality thing.  His food always seems kind of intersting and it would be worth doing a recipe shotout with another batch.  This breaks biscuit flour down for us a ways, which is nice and marginally better for us.",

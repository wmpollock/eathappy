  "preparation": "Soften raisins by putting them in  small amount of hot water.  Prepare candied fruit by dicing and shaking them in a bag with a little flour to coat and separate the fruit.  In a medium bowl dissolve the yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 1/4 cup warm water. In a saucepan, scald milk: bring to 180F in a saucepan over medium heat while stirring constantly -- small bubbles should form.  Stir in shortening and let cool for 15 minutes.Transfer milk mixture to a big mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup sugar, salt and ground cardamom seed. Mix in 2 cups flour, 1 cup at a time.  If using a mixer, start with the paddle attachment.Stir in yeast mixture.  Add in 2 cups flour, 1 cup at a time.  Add candied fruit, raisins, and chopped almonds, mixing well.   If using a mixer, switch to the dough hook at this point.Stir in 2 1/2 cups of remaining flour, 1 cup at a time.Turn dough out on a floured board and kneed well.   Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth.Put dough in a warm place (about 80F) or in a warmed oven (turned off) with a pan of hot water on the bottom rack.  Let dough rise until double, about 45 mins.   Punch down and let rise until double again.Punch down and cut into 2 equal sections.  Knead well.  Form round loaves and place them on a cookie sheet.  Cover with a damp cloth and double once more.Preheat the oven to 350F.  Bake loaves for about 35 minutes -- the tops should be golden brown.",

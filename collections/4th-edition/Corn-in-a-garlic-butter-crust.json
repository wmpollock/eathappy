  "notes": "In the copyright-free future I'd be able to share this wonderful photograph with you as it is truly a gem:  the corn lies on its own cermic dish whose form follows its youthful self's.Now, older, wiser and a good bit more oily, Madame Corni s presented in her naked, bread crumbed form, her crumbing and flesh slightly seared at points to the point of blackness.--It looks handsomer than most fish you might prepare the same way and the cookbook does suggest using the butter-oil-garlic-pepper spread on french loaf which you'd bake in a moderate 300-350F oven for 30 minutes.  They also suggest the same mixture can be used as a panfried garlic crouton base as well.Research: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FISH?",

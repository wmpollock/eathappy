  "notes": "I imagine Merk as a dedicated bachelor devoted to his with the excellent coffee cake.This recipe can be doubled to fit a 9\"x13\" pan, but that's playing with fire a bit:  the top may rise over the edge of the pan when baked.  Not disastrous necessarily, but a bit aggressive.When serving groups with this recipe, it can be made in muffin or brioche pans:  assemble as usual but fill each cup no more than half full.  Bakes in about 25 minutes.",

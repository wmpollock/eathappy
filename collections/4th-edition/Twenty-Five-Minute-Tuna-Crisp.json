  "notes": "I'm not certain how the \"crisp\" vanished from our cultural food landscape.  Perhaps they were crushed under \"light cooking\" or are the simple sort of fare one guiltily does not share outside of one's family.  In any case, I adventured into crisps with this recipe and was quite happy with the results.",

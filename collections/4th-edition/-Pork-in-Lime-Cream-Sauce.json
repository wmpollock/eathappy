  "notes": "The sauce itself is the thing here, whatever meat you put it over is merely a window-dressing.   The variety of things it can go over is quite impossible to understate:  This original recipe goes over pork tenderloins, but you could go over browned chicken medallions, salad, noodles, some combination thereof...Micha upon having it in January 2007 suggested that caserole could be whipped together out of the noodles & chicken Lori and I had been farking over, this with a rather uncondensed version of the sauce with perhaps peas and/or artichoke hearts in some sort of nightmare midwestern goulash meets puttanesca.The thickness is the thing and in addition to cooking the crap out of it until it thickens you can toss in some cottage cheese and go about creaming it up that way when it gets to maybe a cup, cup and a half.Rated \"Fantastic!\" by my mother.",

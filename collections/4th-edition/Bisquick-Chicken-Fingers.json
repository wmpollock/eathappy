  "name": "Bisquick Chicken Fingers",
  "notes": "Betty Crocker calls these \"ultimate\" -- I don't know that I can go all that far but they are indeed pretty tasty for non-fried chicken product.To truly indulge your elegant fingers one should really have a side sauce.  Around our house, a mayo/mustard concoction usually takes center stage though we've used BBQ a time or too as well.  The dish takes sauce infernally well so long as it plays nicely with butter.",

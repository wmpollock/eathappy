  "name": "Cabbage-Pepper Slaw",
  "notes": "I'm a hard-sell on green peppers.  Not much for the flavor, not much for the consistency in any form, but the small pieces of pepper in this recipe give the slaw a nice crisp zing.The dressing is quite tasty but one should probably be careful with the measure of salt and sugar -- the salad dressing mixture I use has plenty of both.  My first making of this came out both overly salty and overly sweet. This was remedied some by some dashes of lemon juice.",

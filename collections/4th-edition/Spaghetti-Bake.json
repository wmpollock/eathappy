  "notes": "I've seen plenty of recipes for Spaghetti Bakes in various community cookbooks.  Its a good way to bridge the gap between spaghetti and lasagna, especially if you have mozarella or other white cheese in danger of going south.Apologies for the rough counts: the four measures counted should, with the onion and garlic, fill a target casserole pretty fully.  Scale accordingly.",

  "preparation": "The assemblage is best made in a ceramic, high-heat container where one can best glaze the onion.  Arrange whole onion slices and the garlic at the bottom of the casserole and cover with a few dashes olive oil.  Glaze/char onion at high heat, 10-15 minutes with a turn midway through for the onions.Remove casserole from heat and allow to cool sufficiently to allow layering of spaghetti, sauce, mushroom, and cheeses.  Bake at 350F for 15-20 minutes or until bubbling.",

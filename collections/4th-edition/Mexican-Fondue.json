  "notes": "My mom. not typically a beer drinker, always used Miller High Life in the recipe.This recipe calls for cherry tomatoes which are fun served whole but I am never able to keep more than a memory the cheese product on the tomato surface very long.  Needs Research: maybe halves work better than wholes?  The mouth-burst makes them the belle of the ball here but are almost better thought of as garnish.This is tranwreck in many ways but a fun trainwreck and fairly tasty.",

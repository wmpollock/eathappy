  "preparation": "Step 1: Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper. Put a large skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add EVOO; when hot, add chops and turn heat to high. Brown for 2 minutes on each side. Step 2: Reduce heat to medium. Add water or wine and garlic and cook, turning chops twice, until the liquid has almost evaporated - 3 minutes. Add stock, turn heat to low, and cover, cooking until chops are tender but not dry, 10 to 15 min. (When they're done, their jucies will run slightly pink.)Step 3: Transfer pork to a platter and cover to keep warm. Add fruit wedges to the skillet, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan. If the pan seems too dry, add another 1/2 cup stock or wine and continue cooking until the fruit is soft and the liquid is reduced slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon the fruit and sauce over the chops and garnish with parsley.",

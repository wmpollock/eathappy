  <notes><![CDATA[This is a bit of an unusual Mac and Cheese, having upon its top a golden breadcrumb and butter mixture which  is probably the best part of the mix.  Any Mac and Cheese without it looks straight-up naked.

This was my number-one favorite dish when I was a kid and the one most often requested as a birthday treat.   This makes a nice, creamy Mac & Cheese that is well worth the effort.  

My mom never used Sriracha in her recipe, but it adds a certain filling warmth and flavor.

REVISION:  In the 2.1 edition of the cookbook I have discovered that while this is a marignally acceptable eyeballer's guide to the recipe it ends up being rather thin on the sauce.  Baking longer helps. Also, my preparation below blows and will be fixed in the next edition (SORRY!)]]></notes>

  <preparation>Melt butter in double boiler and gradually add flour to it.  Cook for "a few minutes" (e.g. until smooth and well-integrated looking) and then add milk a little at a time.

After sauce thickens (evens) add spices and cheese.  Stir occasionally until cheese melts and sauce re-thickens.

While sauce cooks, boil water, add 1 tsp salt and cook macaroni.  If the macaroni finishes before the sauce, rinse the macaroni in a colander and put cover with cold water.  When sauce is ready, drain macaroni.

In 1.5 quart  casserole dish, mix macaroni and sauce in equal portions until dish is filled. Top with bread crumb mix:  2 T melted butter mixed with 1/3 cup dry bread crumbs.

Bake at 350F for 10-15 minutes.

**I have found that this recipe has some problems scaling -- I made a triple batch of it one time and was adding flour until the cows came home AFTER adding the cheese to offset the fluid volume.  The sauce is supposed to be -thick-.

**I find that getting the bread crumb mixture right is kind of tricky to get properly hydrated without being overly saturated with butter, but here's a trick:  I don't actually have a double boiler, I just have two pots and I've found that if you ditch the water from the "water" pot, you've got yourself a nice warm pan to melt sufficient butter in and add bread crumbs -to-, and that does the trick pretty nice.

**I like a little heat in everything.  I've added a bit (2T) of Sriracha to the cheese mixture as it cooked and it combined nicely with the Worchestershire and the sharp cheddar.</preparation>

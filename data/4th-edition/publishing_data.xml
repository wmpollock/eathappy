  <introduction_title>Introduction to the Third Edition</introduction_title>
  <introduction_text><![CDATA[
I had this idea that it would be cool to start collecting recipes.  Some recipes I figured were lost and would have to be recreated.  Some were ones I'd found and liked and didn't want to dig for.

My grandmother kept a giant analog card file written in a number of hands and under a number of typewriters.  My grandmother would sometimes enlist help in re-setting a failing card.

Part of the philosophy of keeping these recipes together is to keep their online presence additionally worthwhile.  It is my freedom to roam with the knowledge that I can nearly always access my recipe collection.  For those places the Internet does not reach I can always bring along the old battered paperback -- great for giving out to friends and taking copious notes on.

It takes stains beter than the Internet.

Also, unlike the Internet, this collection is always powered on.

The impetus for creating the Third Edition were multifold.  Firstly: several of the recipes have been improved upon.  Some of the pages containing these recipes are nearly obliterated with hurried annotations.  Seconly: much has been added.  I've been working through my grandmother's collection, a couple more cookbooks and the always occasional odds and ends from the local paper or a friend.  Much of this has been available all along online but its a drag not to have Ultimate Chicken Fingers in paper form.

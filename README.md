# Eathappy

## Background and goals

Eathappy was started in 2001 after a period of familial estrangement.  During that time I contemplated
a grim future without some of the recipes I had grown up with and grew quite sad.  In the time following
I decided I needed to capture as many of the family recipes as I could as well as provide a repository for
recipes I came across.

The collection began life stored in an Accuchef cookbook of which I kept only one recipe though I'm sure
there were more worth having.

My goals were the long-term preservation of the acquired information.  In 2001 this was best accomplished
by storing in XML which everyone agreed would be the one true data exchange format from the ages.

By the mid 2010s it was clear that everyone had given up on XML and parsing, simple as it was, for stacks
like JSON which were more easily and globally consumed.  Why not just push data?

Indeed.

I don't enter much anymore:  I managed to collect all my grandmother's recipe cards but have quite a few
recipes of my mother's and myself.  Beyond that I have oodles of data that I always imagined I'd either
enter or outsource as well as things like my larger family's cookbook which really needs just normalization.

Anyway, that's this.  Its available online at <http://billpollock.com/eathappy>

In the future I hope to move towards a single-page architecture backed by JSON.  While I'd love to provide
ElasticSearch I'm not made of cash but am looking to use it maybe to assist in the normalization of ingredient
names because there's only so many ways one needs to say "shortening" for example.  The so many ways is in
fact one and its not Crisco.  There are a good dozen others like this I'm sure.
